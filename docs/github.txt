Infrastructure Monitoring and Log Analytics Data Pipeline

Executive Summary

A production-ready, serverless data pipeline built on AWS that automates infrastructure monitoring, log analytics, and real-time alerting. This project demonstrates end-to-end data engineering and site reliability engineering (SRE) practices while maintaining cost efficiency through AWS Free Tier services.

Project Overview

This data pipeline collects, processes, stores, and visualizes infrastructure metrics and application logs in real-time. Built entirely with AWS serverless technologies, the system provides actionable insights into system health, performance bottlenecks, and operational anomalies.

Key Features
• Automated Data Collection: Lambda functions collect infrastructure metrics and application logs on scheduled intervals
• Real-time Processing: Event-driven architecture processes data streams with minimal latency
• Scalable Storage: S3 for log archives with intelligent lifecycle policies; DynamoDB for fast metric queries
• Intelligent Alerting: CloudWatch alarms trigger notifications for critical threshold breaches
• Cost-Optimized: Designed to run within AWS Free Tier limits (~$0-5/month)

Architecture Highlights

AWS Services Used:
• AWS Lambda - Serverless compute for data collection and processing
• Amazon S3 - Durable storage for raw logs with automated lifecycle management
• Amazon DynamoDB - NoSQL database for time-series metrics and fast queries
• Amazon CloudWatch - Monitoring, logging, and alerting infrastructure
• Amazon EventBridge - Event-driven orchestration and scheduling
• AWS IAM - Fine-grained security and access control

Monitoring Capabilities

The pipeline tracks critical infrastructure health indicators and triggers alerts for:
• CPU Utilization - Alerts when usage exceeds 80% threshold
• Memory Consumption - Notifications for memory usage above 85%
• Error Rate Monitoring - Detects when application error rates breach acceptable limits
• Pipeline Health - Automatic detection and alerting for data pipeline component failures
• Custom Metrics - Extensible framework for adding domain-specific monitoring

Technical Skills Demonstrated
• Data Engineering: ETL pipeline design, data modeling, storage optimization
• Site Reliability Engineering: Monitoring, alerting, incident detection, operational excellence
• Cloud Architecture: Serverless design patterns, event-driven systems, cost optimization
• Infrastructure as Code: Reproducible deployments, version-controlled infrastructure
• DevOps Practices: CI/CD readiness, automated testing, documentation

Project Goals
Build a scalable, production-grade monitoring solution
Demonstrate proficiency with AWS serverless technologies
Implement SRE best practices for observability and reliability
Create comprehensive documentation for knowledge sharing
Maintain cost efficiency while ensuring high availability
